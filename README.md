> The Shadowy Learning Path it's still in **beta** and will change very often.

Welcome to the repository that contains the challenges for the **Shadowy Learning Path**! Here you'll find, for each path (*frontend*, *backend* or *contracts*) and each level the challenge you **must** complete in order to obtain the badge!

## ‚ùì How does it work?

Since we're still working on a website where to handle all the challenges, we decided to create this repository for the public to tackle the challenges we propose inside our learning path.

There are 3 main folders inside the `root` directory, one for each path. Inside each folder, there are all the folders relative to each level (eg. `level-2` inside the `frontend` folder is where there is the challenge for the fourth level of the Frontend path).

Each level folder contains a `README.md` file, some (optional) code files that you'll need to fill and a `BADGES.md` file:
- The `README.md` file contains all the instructions for the challenge, and **must be read before writing any code**;
- The code files, if present, are what you'll need to fill and run in order to pass the challenge;
- The `BADGES.md` file contains all the users that tackled correctly that challenge.

## üìö Challenge verification

After you've finished writing your code in your forked repository, you'll create a PR (pull request) on this repository updating the `BADGES.md` file with your username and the link to your forked repo.

In order to speed-up the challenge verification process, we created a Telegram group (`@TODO`) where you can ping one of the Shadowers to go and check your newly submitted PR: if you succeeded in beating the challenge, your pull request will be accepted and your name will appear in the `BADGES.md` file.
