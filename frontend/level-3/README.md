# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Level 3 Challenge

The **Level 2 Challenge** for the _Frontend_ learning path consists in creating a `ConnectWalletButton` in **VueJS**. What you'll need to do is to fill the `ConnectWalletButton.vue` and `ConnectWalletButton.ts` files by updating both the logic and the UI respectively. The `connectWallet()` function must allow the user to connect his wallet using **Metamask** and display the user wallet address inside.

After you've finished your work, simply run on your terminal:

```bash
npm run exercise // or yarn run exercise
```

And then choose `Frontend` and `Level 3` as the options: it will prompt to you the results of your work!
Otherwise you can just run the level 3 exercise by running the following command:

```bash
npm run exercise frontend 3 // or yarn run exercise frontend 3
```
