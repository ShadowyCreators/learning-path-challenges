# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Level 3 Challenge

The **Level 2 Challenge** for the _Frontend_ learning path consists in creating a `ConnectWalletButton` in **VueJS**. What you'll need to do is to fill the `ConnectWalletButton.vue` and `ConnectWalletButton.ts` files by updating both the logic and the UI respectively. The `connectWallet()` function must allow the user to connect his wallet using **Metamask** and display the user wallet address inside.

Currently there is no automated way **yet** to test this exercise.
