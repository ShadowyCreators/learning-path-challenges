# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Level 1 Challenge

The **Level 1 Challenge** for the _Frontend_ learning path consists in 4 main exercises:

- In the first one, you'll need to define the `User` type accordingly to the data provided to you;
- In the second exercise, you'll define the `Person` user based on the `User` type you defined before and the `Admin` type;
- In the third one, you'll define two basic functions (`isAdmin` e `isUser`) that must return true if the incoming `Person` is an `Admin` or a `User` respectively;
- In the last one, you'll add annotations to a class that manipulates `Objects` in a cool way.

After you've finished your work, simply run on your terminal:

```bash
npm run exercise // or yarn run exercise
```

And then choose `Frontend` and `Level 1` as the options: it will prompt to you the results of your work!
Otherwise you can just run the level 1 exercise by running the following command:

```bash
npm run exercise frontend 1 // or yarn run exercise frontend 1
```
