# ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Level 2 Challenge

The **Level 2 Challenge** for the _Frontend_ learning path dives deeper into JavaScript and its advanced features.

The first exercise consists in writing a regular expression that returns true if the input string has the first character uppercase, false otherwise.

In the second exercise you need to write a regular expression that returns true if the pattern matches an e-mail address.
An e-mail address is composed of the following characters:

- uppercase and lowercase letters;
- digits;
- special characters (! # $ % & ' \* + - / = ? ^ \_ ` { | } ~);
- 'dot' character.

In the third exercise, you need to write a function that retrieves data from a placeholder REST API and returns a list of string composed by the `userId`, `id` and first word of the `title` from the retrieved data.

After you've finished your work, simply run on your terminal (remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you didn't previously):

```bash
npm run exercise // or yarn run exercise
```

And then choose `Frontend` and `Level 2` as the options: it will prompt to you the results of your work!
Otherwise you can just run the level 2 exercise by running the following command:

```bash
npm run exercise frontend 2 // or yarn run exercise frontend 2
```
