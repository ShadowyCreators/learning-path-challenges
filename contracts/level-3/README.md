# ðŸ‘¾ Contracts Level 3 Challenge

In the **Level 3 Challenge** for the _Contracts_ path you'll be creating the `Attack.sol` contract that needs to exploit the re-entrancy vulnerability present in the `Vulnerable.sol` contract

You must implement the logic inside the `attack()` function and add other functions you think may help you.

**HINT**: implement a `fallback` function.

After you've finished your work, simply run on your terminal (remember to run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you didn't previously):

```bash
npm run exercise // or yarn run exercise
```

And then choose `Contract` and `Level 3` as the options: it will prompt to you the results of your work!
Otherwise you can just run the level 3 exercise by running the following command:

```bash
npm run exercise contracts 3 // or yarn run exercise contracts 3
```
