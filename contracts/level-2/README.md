# ðŸ‘¾ Contracts Level 2 Challenge

The **Level 2 Challenge** for the _Contracts_ path consists in updating some functions inside the `ShadowyNFT.sol` contract.

The contract must work in this way:

- Users can mint NFTs by paying **exactly** 1 ETH;
- Users can burn **their own NFTs** (note: must revert if it's not the case);
- The owner of the contract can withdraw all the ETH inside the `ShadowyNFT` contract.

After you've finished your work, simply run on your terminal:

```bash
npm run exercise
```

And then choose `Contract` and `Level 2` as the options: it will prompt to you the results of your work!
